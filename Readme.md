# Load Balancer Coding Assignment

All the requirements should be met: please see `LoadBalancerTest`.

Since this assignment definitely requires more that 2 hours to complete, I would consider this version as a first iteration.

The next iteration would include:
1. Proper unit testing
2. Proper logging with different levels
3. API description
4. Probably more sophisticated concurrency handling
